# S-NOTAM (Capstone Group S)

## Project Overview

On January 11th, 2023, a failure in the FAA's NOTAM (Notice to Air Missions) system grounded all U.S. flights for two hours. While NOTAMs provide essential flight information, the sheer volume and inclusion of less relevant details make it difficult for pilots to identify critical notices.

## :star2: Objectives

This project aims to design a system that:
- Fetches all applicable NOTAMs for a flight, given its departure and destination airports within the continental United States.

- Displays the NOTAMs in a prioritized manner, highlighting the most critical information to help pilots identify potential hazards.

## :computer: Data File Downloads

This project uses airport data from the FAA's Airports and Other Landing Facilities (APT) dataset. To obtain the necessary file:

1. Visit the FAA NASR Suscription page: https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/aero_data/NASR_Subscription/2025-03-20/.

2. Scroll down to the list of downloadable files.

3. Find and download the ZIP file labeled: Airports and Other Landing Facilities (APT).

4. Extract the ZIP archive on your computer.

5. From the etracted contents, locate the file named: APT_BASE.csv.

6. Move or copy APT_BASE.csv to the root directory.

## :Machine_Learning: (In Progress...)
"I built three increasingly sophisticated approaches to the same problem and compared them."

Labelling of data will be done via an LLM label generator. (weak supervision, did it work?)

Layer 1 — Baseline: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression
A classical NLP classifier. Fast to build, easy to explain, and gives you a performance benchmark. This is your "simple model" that everything else is compared against.

Layer 2 — Better Features: Sentence Embeddings + Random Forest
Use a pretrained sentence-transformers model to turn NOTAM text into semantic vectors, then classify with Random Forest. This shows you understand that raw text → numbers is a design choice, not just a given.

Layer 3 — Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest
On top of the embeddings from Layer 2, flag NOTAMs that are statistically unusual — ones that don't cluster well with any known category. This is your "bonus" component that makes the project feel complete.
